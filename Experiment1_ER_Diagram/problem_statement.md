# Experiment 1: Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

## 🎯 Objective:
To understand and apply the concepts of ER modeling by creating an ER diagram for a real-world application.

## 📚 Purpose:
The purpose of this workshop is to gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that visually represent the structure of a database including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

---

## 🧪 Choose One Scenario:

### 🔹 Scenario 1: University Database
Design a database to manage students, instructors, programs, courses, and student enrollments. Include prerequisites for courses.

**User Requirements:**
- Academic programs grouped under departments.
- Students have admission number, name, DOB, contact info.
- Instructors with staff number, contact info, etc.
- Courses have number, name, credits.
- Track course enrollments by students and enrollment date.
- Add support for prerequisites (some courses require others).

---

### 🔹 Scenario 2: Hospital Database
Design a database for patient management, appointments, medical records, and billing.

**User Requirements:**
- Patient details including contact and insurance.
- Doctors and their departments, contact info, specialization.
- Appointments with reason, time, patient-doctor link.
- Medical records with treatments, diagnosis, test results.
- Billing and payment details for each appointment.

---

## 📝 Tasks:
1. Identify entities, relationships, and attributes.
2. Draw the ER diagram using any tool (draw.io, dbdiagram.io, hand-drawn and scanned).
3. Include:
   - Cardinality & participation constraints
   - Prerequisites for University OR Billing for Hospital
4. Explain:
   - Why you chose the entities and relationships.
   - How you modeled prerequisites or billing.

## Entities and Attributes:
Student: Student Name, Register Number, Age, DOB, Year
Department: Name, Faculties, Lab
Enrollment: Course Code, Credits
Course: Name, Course Code, Faculty, Domain, Prerequisites
Faculty: Name, Department

## Relationships and Constraints:
Student — Belongs To — Department Cardinality: Many-to-One (Many students belong to one department)
Participation: Total (Every student must belong to a department)

Student — Does — Enrollment Cardinality: One-to-Many (A student can have many enrollment records)
Participation: Total (If a student is taking courses, they must be enrolled)

Enrollment — Has — Course Cardinality: Many-to-One (Each enrollment is for one course, but each course can have many enrollments)
Participation: Total on Enrollment (An enrollment must be for a course)

Student — Enrolls — Course Cardinality: Many-to-Many (A student can enroll in many courses, and a course can have many students)
Participation: Partial

Course — Teaches — Faculty Cardinality: Many-to-One (Each course is taught by one faculty, a faculty can teach many courses)
Participation: Total on Course

Faculty — Belongs To — Department Cardinality: Many-to-One (Each faculty member belongs to one department)

## Extension (Prerequisite / Billing):
A course can have one or more other courses as prerequisites.

This is represented using a many-to-many recursive relationship.

## Design Choices:
Student, Course, Faculty, Department are fundamental academic components.

Enrollment is a bridge entity for a many-to-many relationship between Students and Courses, while also capturing enrollment metadata (e.g., credits, prerequisites).

Department helps in structuring programs and associating faculty and students.tionships, and assumptions

## RESULT
The ER model accurately represents an academic system with students, courses, faculty, departments, enrollments, and supports prerequisites through a recursive course relationship.
